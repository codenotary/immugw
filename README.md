**immugw** is the intelligent REST proxy that connects to immudb and provides a RESTful interface for applications. We recommend to run immudb and immugw on separate machines to enhance security


#### Build the binaries yourself

To build the binaries yourself, simply clone this repo and run

```
make all
```

#### immugw first start

##### Run immugw binary

```bash
# run immugw in the foreground
./immugw
```
##### Run immugw as a service

Service installation and management are supported on Linux, Windows, OSX and FreeBSD operating systems.

```
# install immugw service
./immuadmin service immugw install

# check current immugw service status
./immuadmin service immugw status

# stop immugw service
./immuadmin service immugw stop

# start immugw service
./immuadmin service immugw start
```

The linux service is using the following defaults:

| File or configuration   | location                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| executable              | /usr/sbin/immugw           |
| all configuration files | /etc/immugw                |
| pid file                | /var/lib/immugw/immugw.pid |
| log files               | /var/log/immugw            |

The FreeBSD service is using the following defaults:

| File or configuration   | location            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| executable              | /usr/sbin/immugw    |
| all configuration files | /etc/immugw         |
| pid file                | /var/run/immugw.pid |
| log files               | /var/log/immugw     |

The Windows service is using the following defaults:

| File or configuration   | location                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------
| executable              | Program Files\Immugw\immugw.exe      |
| configuration file      | ProgramData\Immugw\config\immugw.toml|
| all data files          | ProgramData\Immugw\                  |
| pid file                | ProgramData\Immugw\config\immugw.pid |
| log file                | ProgramData\Immugw\config\immugw.log |



Simply run `./immugw -d` to start immugw on the same machine as immudb (test or dev environment) or pointing to the remote immudb system ```./immugw --immudb-address "immudb-server"```.

If you want to stop immugw Ã®n that case you need to find the process `ps -ax | grep immugw` and then `kill -15 <pid>`. Windows PowerShell would be `Get-Process immugw* | Stop-Process`.

immu gateway: a smart REST proxy for immudb - the lightweight, high-speed immutable database for systems and applications.

### Docker

**immugw**  is also available as docker images on dockerhub.com.

| Component  | Container image                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| immugw     | https://hub.docker.com/r/codenotary/immugw     |

#### Run immugw

```
docker run -it -d -p 3323:3323 --name immugw --env IMMUGW_IMMUDB_ADDRESS=immudb codenotary/immugw:latest
```


#### Build the container images yourself

If you want to build the container images yourself, simply clone this repo and run

```
docker build -t myown/immugw:latest -f Dockerfile .
```

## Why immugw

**immugw** provides a simple solution to interact with immudb with REST protocol, without taking in charge the merkle tree root hash file management and concurrency related complexity.

#### immugw communication

**immugw**  proxies REST client communication and gRPC server interface. For security purposes immugw should not run on the same server as immudb. The following diagram shows how the communication works:
